Your task is to make a work log i.e. make a document that details who is working on what, with each work item being 1 line. You have to do this for the following people

- shubhankiit
- amar13mehta
- kunal00000
- milind-foyer
- parinay-mero
- PriyanshuUpadhyay
- puneet1337
- shahbaz-foyer
- Shantanu-Vispute
- shubhoberaa
- vedant-foyer

To do this

1. Read linear tickets via MCP assigned to each person and show the ones that are in any status other than "Done"
2. Check the "Open" PRs opened by each person in /Users/siddharthasaxena/foyer/frontend/merlin-monorepo/apps/website using command line tools.
3. Check the "Open" PRs opened by each person in /Users/siddharthasaxena/foyer/frontend/merlin-monorepo/apps/arcane using command line tools.

Do not look at recent commits or merged PRs but only the open PRs. Finally make the document in the folder ~/work/17-June-2025/[name].md. The file should demark all the 3 components separately and have brief descriptions of each point.
